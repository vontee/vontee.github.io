   <h2>Everyday usage and use in mathematics</h2>
<p> The word <b>absolute</b> in everyday English means means "total" or "complete." The Oxford English Dictionary provides many definitions for the word <b>absolute</b> <a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">[1]</a> such as "Free from dependency, autonomous; not relative" or "Complete, perfect." 

<p> For example, an <i>absolute monarch</i> is a ruler who has total control over their country. The term <i>absolute zero</i> refers to the smallest possible temperature and a complete lack of atomic movement.

<p> The term <i>absolute value</i> is used in two related ways in mathematics. The first meaning of absolute value is the <b>absolute value of a real number</b>. The absolute value of a real number is the <a href="piecwise-function.html">piecewise function</a> given by the formula
\[|x| = \begin{cases}
 x & \text{if $x \geq 0$} \\
-x & \text{if $x < 0$.} \end{cases} \]
The absolute value captures the size of a number wihtout regard to whether the number is positive or negative. The absolute value $|x|$ of $x$ is the distance from $x$ to zero on a number line.

<p> The term <i>absolute value</i> is also used to refer to the <b>absolute value of a complex number</b>. This is sometimes referred to as the <b>modulus.</b> If $a + bi$ is a <a href="complex-number.html">complex number</a>, then the absolute value of $a + bi$ is given by the formula
\[|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.\]
The absolute value of a complex number is the distance from the complex number to zero in the complex plane.
    <h3>Summary</h3>
The term <b>absolute value</b> captures the total distance of a number to zero without regard to whether the number is positive, negative, or complex. 
      <h2>Importance in mathematics</h2>
	The absolute value function is important when describing the size of a change without regard to whether the change is positive or negative.  For example, an <a href="interval.html">interval</a> $(a,b)$ is the set of points satisfying the inequality 
\[\left|x - \frac{a + b}{2} \right| \leq \frac{b - a}{2}.\]
For this reason, absolute values are useful in describing bounds on the error in measuring a quantity. 
	In the complex plane, absolute value inequalities are used to describe discs rather than intervals. If $x_0 + i y_0$ is a complex number, then the set of complex numbers $x + i y$ satisfying the inequality 
\[|(x + i y) - (x_0 + i y_0)| < r\]
is a disc of radius $r$ centered at the point $(x_0, y_0)$.
      <h2>Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
	<li>Give a definition of the word <i>absolute</i>. Is there a similar term in your native language? 
	<li>Compare the use of absolute in <b>absolute value</b> and the use of the word absolute in <a href=absolute-maximum-and-minimum>absolute maximum</a>
	<li>Describe the set of real numbers $x$ that satisfy the absolute value inequality $|x - 3| \geq 5$.
