      <h2>Everyday usage and use in mathematics</h2>
      <p id="rate">In everyday language, the term "rate" refers to the speed or frequency of an event over a specific period of time. For instance, your heart-rate is the number of times your heart beats every minute, while an annual percentage rate (APR) is the percentage of a debt that that debt increases by every year.</p>
      <p id="change">The word "change" refers to the act or process of becoming different. In mathematics, "rate of change" has a precise meaning that's intuitive based on the everyday use of those words. It quantifies how much an output quantity varies relative to an input quantity. </p>

      <h2>Importance in mathematics</h2>
      <p>Rate of change is often represented by the slope of a line in a graph, which shows how much one variable changes on relative to the change in another variable. The Greek letter delta (Δ) is commonly used to denote change. For example, \( Δy / Δx \) represents the change in \(y\) (output) relative to the change in \(x\) (input).</p>
      <h2 id="slope">Slope</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, the term <strong>slope</strong> describes the steepness or incline of a surface, such as a hill or roof. For example, a "steep slope" indicates a sharp incline, while a "gentle slope" refers to a more gradual incline.</p>
      <p>
         In mathematics, the term <strong>slope</strong> specifically refers to a measure of the steepness or incline of a line on a graph. 
         It is defined as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between two points on the line. 
         Mathematically, the slope \( m \) is given by the formula:
         \[
         m = \frac{{y_2 - y_1}}{{x_2 - x_1}}
         \]
         where \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are two distinct points on the line.
      </p>
      <h2>Importance in mathematics</h2>
      <p>Slope is used to describe the rate of change of a function, which indicates how a quantity changes in relation to another. In the context of a linear equation, the slope tells us how much the output (\( y \)) changes for a unit change in the input (\( x \)).</p>
      <p>For example, in the equation of a straight line, \( y = mx + b \), the slope \( m \) represents the rate of change of \( y \) with respect to \( x \). 
         If \( m \) is positive, the line slopes upward, indicating that as \( x \) increases, \( y \) also increases. 
         If \( m \) is negative, the line slopes downward, showing that as \( x \) increases, \( y \) decreases. 
         A zero slope means</p>
