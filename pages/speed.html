      <h2>Everyday Usage and Use in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, "speed" refers to how fast something is moving, typically along a straight path. For instance, when we say a car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, we are describing its linear speed. Similarly in math and science, speed describes motion along a path. Linear speed refers to how fast an object moves along a path, while angular speed measures how fast it rotates or turns around a point.</p>

      
      <h2>Importance in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>Linear and angular speed describe how quickly an object moves in straight or circular paths. Linear speed measures the distance traveled over time, while angular speed measures how fast an object rotates. In circular motion, knowing the angular speed of a wheel helps calculate the linear speed at its edge. These concepts are used in fields like engineering for designing gears, pulleys, and wheels.</p>


      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>Linear speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. For example, if a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, its linear speed is:</p>
      <p>\[
      \text{Linear Speed} = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour}
      \]</p>
      
      <p>Angular speed is calculated by dividing the angle traversed by the time taken. For example, if a wheel completes one full rotation (which is \(2\pi\) radians) in 4 seconds, its angular speed is:</p>
      <p>\[
      \text{Angular Speed} = \frac{2\pi \text{ radians}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians per second}
      \]</p>
      
      <p>Linear speed and angular speed are related by the equation:</p>
      <p>\[
      \text{Linear Speed} = \text{Radius} \times \text{Angular Speed}
      \]</p>
      <p>This equation shows how the linear speed at the edge of a rotating object increases with both the angular speed and the radius of the circular path.</p>
      
      <h2>Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>A bicycle wheel has a radius of 0.35 meters and rotates at 2 radians per second. What is the linear speed at the edge of the wheel?</li>
          <li>A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. Calculate its linear speed.</li>
          <li>If a turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute (RPM), what is its angular speed in radians per second?</li>
