      <h2>Everyday Usage and Use in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, zero refers to the number 0, which represents nothing or the absence of quantity; for example, "zero people" means no one is present. It's the point between positive and negative numbers on the number line.</p>

      <p><b>Zeros</b> of a function are the values where the function equals zero (\( f(x) = 0 \)), often where its graph crosses the x-axis. The term <b>roots</b> is sometimes used for the zeros of a polynomial.</p>

      <h2>Importance in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>Zeros of functions represent <a href=".\intercept.html">x-intercepts</a> of the graph of a function. These points can provide significant information about the behavior of the function, such as changes in sign or the locations of critical points.</p>

      <p>For example, finding the zeros of a quadratic function can help in determining the points where a projectile will land or the break-even points in a financial model. Zeros are also fundamental in calculus, particularly in the study of polynomial functions, as they help in solving equations and optimizing functions.</p>
