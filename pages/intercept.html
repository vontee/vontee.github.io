      <h2>Everyday Usage of "Intercept"</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, the word intercept describes the act of stopping or capturing something on its way from one place to another. For example, in American football, a defensive player may <i>intercept</i> a pass, meaning they catch the ball in air before it reaches the player the ball was thrown to.</p>

      <h2>Importance in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>In mathematics, the concept of intercept is specifically related to graphs of functions, particularly linear functions. There are two types of intercepts commonly discussed: the x-intercept and the y-intercept.</p>

      <h3>Y-Intercept</h3>
      <p>The y-intercept is the point where a graph crosses the y-axis. This occurs when the input (or x-value) is zero. Mathematically, if we have a linear equation in slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \), the y-intercept is the value of \( b \). For instance, in the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \), the y-intercept is 3, meaning the graph crosses the y-axis at the point \((0, 3)\).</p>

      <h3>X-Intercept</h3>
      <p>The x-intercept is the point where a graph crosses the x-axis. This occurs when the output (or y-value) is zero. To find the x-intercept, we set \( y = 0 \) and solve for \( x \). For example, in the equation \( y = 2x + 3 \), setting \( y = 0 \) gives \( 0 = 2x + 3 \), which simplifies to \( x = -1.5 \). Thus, the x-intercept is \((-1.5, 0)\).</p>
