         <h2>MURPA Program and Support</h2>
         <p>This resource is part of a project supported by the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research and Practice Award (MURPA) at Wichita State University. The goal of this project is to develop a linguistic resource for students learning English as a second language who are also enrolled in mathematics courses. With goals students understand mathematical concepts through an exploration of everyday English and technical terminology.</p>
