   <h2>Everyday Usage</h2>
   <p>The word "magnitude" is often used in everyday language to describe the size, extent, or importance of something. For example, one might refer to the "magnitude of a problem" to emphasize how large or significant the problem is. Similarly, the "magnitude of an earthquake" refers to the strength or size of the seismic event.</p>
   
   <h2>Mathematical and Scientific Usage</h2>
   <p>In mathematics, particularly in the context of vectors, the term "magnitude" has a specific and precise meaning. The magnitude of a vector is a measure of its length, regardless of its direction. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction.</p>
   
   <p>The magnitude of a vector <b>\(\mathbf{v}\)</b>, denoted as <b>\(|\mathbf{v}|\)</b>, can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a vector in a two-dimensional space with components <b>\(\mathbf{v} = \langle x, y \rangle\)</b>, the magnitude is given by:</p>
   
   <p>\[
       |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]</p>
   
   <p>In three-dimensional space, where a vector has components <b>\(\mathbf{v} = \langle x, y, z \rangle\)</b>, the magnitude is:</p>
   
   <p>\[
        |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
   \]</p>
   
   <p>The magnitude of a vector is always a non-negative number. It represents the distance from the vector's initial point to its terminal point.</p>
   
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>
           <b>Two-Dimensional Vector</b>: Consider the vector <b>\(\mathbf{v} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle\)</b>. The magnitude of this vector is calculated as:
           <p>\[
           |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
           \]</p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <b>Three-Dimensional Vector</b>: For a vector <b>\(\mathbf{v} = \langle 1, 2, 2 \rangle\)</b>, the magnitude is:
           <p>\[
           |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 4} = \sqrt{9} = 3
           \]</p>
       </li>
   </ol>
   
   <h2>Importance in Mathematics</h2>
   <p>The magnitude of a vector is commonly used in physics, engineering, and mathematics to determine distances, lengths, and norms. It plays a significant role in operations such as vector normalization, where a vector is scaled to have a magnitude of one while retaining its direction, resulting in what is called a unit vector. Understanding the magnitude of vectors is essential for analyzing physical quantities like force, velocity, and displacement, which are represented as vectors.</p>
   
   <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Calculate the magnitude of the vector <b>\(\mathbf{v} = \langle -7, 24 \rangle\)</b>.</li>
        <li>Find the magnitude of the vector <b>\(\mathbf{v} = \langle 0, -4, 3 \rangle\)</b>.</li>
        <li>A vector has components <b>\(\langle 5, 12, 0 \rangle\)</b>. What is its magnitude?</li>
    </ol>
