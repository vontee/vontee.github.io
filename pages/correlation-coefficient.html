      <h2>Everyday Usage and usage in mathematics</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, the word correlate is used to describe a relationship or connection between two things. For example, we might say "The amount of sleep you get correlates with your overall health," meaning that there is a connection between the amount of sleep and your health where changes in one are associated with changes in the other.</p>
	<p>The term <b>correlation coefficient</b> is used in mathematics with a technical meaning that is similar to the everyday use of the word correlation. denoted by \( r \), is a numerical value that indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.</p>

	<h2>Importance in mathematics</h2>
      <p><b>Linear Relationships:</b> The correlation coefficient is meaningful primarily when the data exhibits a linear relationship. For instance, if you're plotting data points on a graph and they lie close to a straight line, the correlation coefficient tells you how well the data points fit that line.</p>
      <p><b>Values of \( r \):</b> The correlation coefficient can range from \( -1 \) to \( 1 \):</p>
      <ul>
         <li>\( r > 0 \) suggests a positive relationship, meaning as one variable increases, so does the other.</li>
         <li>\( r < 0 \) suggests a negative relationship, meaning as one variable increases, the other decreases.</li>
         <li>The closer \( r \) is to \( 0 \), the more scattered the data points are, indicating a weaker linear relationship.</li>
         <li>The closer \( r \) is to \( 1 \) or \( -1 \), the less scattered the data points are, indicating a stronger linear relationship.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Interpreting \( r \):</b> If \( r \) is close to \( 1 \) or \( -1 \), the data closely follows a straight line, meaning the relationship between the variables is strong and predictable. Conversely, if \( r \) is near \( 0 \), the data points are more dispersed, and the relationship between the variables is weak.</p>

	<h2>Exercises</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Does your native language have a word that means the same thing as correlation? Try to describe the meaning of the English word correlation in your native language.</li>
	<li>If $t$ is the time spent studying for an exam and $s$ is the score on the exam, would you expect the correlation coefficient between the variables $s$ and $t$ to be positive or negative?</li>
	</ul>
