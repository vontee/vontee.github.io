      <h2>Everyday Usage and Use in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>Compound in everyday language typically refers to something made up of two or more parts, like a compound word ("notebook") or a compound substance (water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen).</p>

      <h2>Meaning Within Mathematics</h2>
      <p>In mathematics, particularly in finance, compound primarily refers to the concept of compound interest. This is a method of calculating interest where the interest earned over time is added to the principal, and future interest calculations are based on this increased amount.</p>

      <p>The formula for compound interest is:</p>
      <p class="math display">\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>A:</b> The amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.</li>
         <li><b>P:</b> The principal amount.</li>
         <li><b>r:</b> The annual interest rate (as a decimal).</li>
         <li><b>n:</b> The number of times interest is compounded per year.</li>
         <li><b>t:</b> The time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This concept illustrates the exponential growth of investments or debts over time due to the repeated application of interest on an ever-growing principal.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Compound in mathematics, particularly in finance, is closely associated with the concept of compound interest, where interest is calculated on both the initial principal and the interest that has already been added, leading to exponential growth.</p>
