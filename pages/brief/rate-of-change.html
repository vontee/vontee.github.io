      <h2>Everyday usage and use in mathematics</h2>
      <p id="rate">In everyday language, the term "rate" refers to the speed or frequency of an event over a specific period of time. For instance, your heart-rate is the number of times your heart beats every minute, while an annual percentage rate (APR) is the percentage of a debt that that debt increases by every year.</p>
      <p id="change">The word "change" refers to the act or process of becoming different. In mathematics, "rate of change" has a precise meaning that's intuitive based on the everyday use of those words. It quantifies how much an output quantity varies relative to an input quantity. </p>

      <h2>Importance in mathematics</h2>
      <p>Rate of change is often represented by the slope of a line in a graph, which shows how much one variable changes on relative to the change in another variable. The Greek letter delta (Δ) is commonly used to denote change. For example, \( Δy / Δx \) represents the change in \(y\) (output) relative to the change in \(x\) (input).</p>
