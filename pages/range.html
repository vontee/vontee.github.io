      <h2>Everyday usage and use in mathematics</h2>
      <p>The word <b>range</b> usually refers to the extent or scope of something. The Oxford English Dictionary defines <b>range</b><a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">[1]</a> as 'The area of variation between the upper and lower limits on a particular scale', essentially meaning, the minimum and maximum value of something, and everything between. For instance, we might say that a singer has a wide vocal range, meaning they can sing notes from low to high. Similarly, the range of a car refers to the maximum distance it can travel on a full tank of fuel. In mathematics, the range refers to the set of all possible output values a <a href="/pages/function.html">function</a> can produce, which aligns with the idea of covering the full extent from minimum to maximum.</p>
      
      <h2>Importance in mathematics</h2>
      <p>In mathematics, the <b>range</b> of a function is the set of all possible output values it can produce. Just as a singer's vocal range defines the limits of the notes they can hit, and the range of a car tells us how far it can travel, the range of a function defines the extent of its possible outputs. This mathematical concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of functions and their applications.</p>

      <h2>Comparison</h2>
      <p>The comparison between everyday usage and mathematical usage of <b>range</b> reveals a shared underlying idea: the full extent of potential outcomes. Whether describing the notes a singer can hit, the distance a car can travel, or the values a function can generate, <b>range</b> always conveys the idea of limits and extents.</p>

      <h2>Exercises</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Everyday Context: List three more examples of how <b>range</b> is used in everyday language.
            <br>Example: The range of temperatures in a desert.</li>
         <li>Mathematical Context: Given the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), determine its range.</li>
         <li>Comparison: Explain how the concept of range is similar in both everyday and mathematical contexts using your own words.</li>
      </ol>
