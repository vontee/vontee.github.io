      <h2>Poly- (Prefix)</h2>
      <p>The prefix poly- means "many" or "much" and comes from the Greek word "polys." Itâ€™s commonly used to describe something with multiple parts, like "polygon" (many sides) or "polyglot" (many languages).</p>

      <h2>Importance in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>In math, poly- often indicates multiple elements. A polynomial is an expression made up of terms that include variables raised to non-negative integer powers combined by addition or subtraction. For example, \( 3x^2 + 5x - 7 \) is a polynomial with three terms.</p>
