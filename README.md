## Issues
- **Search function should search page contents, not just titles**
   - ('Slope' is on page 'Rate of Change')

- **Sidebar sometimes disappears on keypress**
   - (Cannot type into search box)

-  **Dark mode toggle doesn't update iframe (Sidebar navigation and ToC)**
   - (Do not set to refresh on toggle!)


## Unfinished Pages!
  - Arithmetic
  - Notation
  - Multiplicity
  - Sides of a right triangles
