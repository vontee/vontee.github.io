      <p>everyday: the term "multiplicity" is not commonly used in everyday language. When it is used, it generally refers to something having multiple parts or elements.</p>
      <p><b>Mathematical Usage</b>: In mathematics, especially in algebra, multiplicity refers to the number of times a particular root or solution occurs in a polynomial equation.</p>

      <h2>Importance in Mathematics</h2>
      <p>useful for understanding the behavior of polynomials, especially at their roots. The multiplicity of a root can indicate whether the graph of a polynomial touches or crosses the x-axis at that root. It also plays a role in determining the degree of a polynomial and its factorization.</p>

       <p>find the multiplicity of the root \( x = 3 \) in the polynomial \( (x - 3)^4(x + 2)^2 \).
